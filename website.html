			<li><h3>Rules</h3></li>
				<ul><h4>
					<li>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.</li>
					<li> The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end.</li>
					<li> The batting side's players score runs by striking the bowled ball with a bat and running between the wickets, while the bowling side tries to prevent this by keeping the ball within the field and getting it to either wicket, and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").</li>
					<li> Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run.</li>
					<li> When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.</li>
					<li> The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.</li>
				</h4></ul>
			<li><h3>Playing Area</h3></li>
				<ul><h4>
					<li>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field between two teams of eleven players each.</li>
					<li>The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.</li>
					<li>In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.</li>
					<li>The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting).</li>
					<li> Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.</li>

			<li><h3>Equipment</h3></li>
				<ul><h4>
					<li>The wicket-keeper (a specialised fielder behind the batter) and the batters wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and presents a major health and safety concern.</li>
					<li> Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area).</li>
					<li> Some batters wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads.</li>
					<li>The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batter (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.</li>
					<li>Subject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); cricket cap (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction.</li>
					<li>The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead,</li>
